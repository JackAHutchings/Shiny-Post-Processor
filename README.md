#### Shiny App(s) for Post-Processing Instrument Data
***
#### Introduction

This project is envisioned to be a set of Shiny Apps designed to handle the data reduction of various instruments used within the fields of isotope and organic geochemistry. As the initial proof-of-concept, the first App to be developed is designed to handle GC-HTC-IRMS dD data. The post-analysis data reduction for this type of data can range from little (if most processing is done within the instrument software and/or certain precautions and limits to operating conditions are held) to many (if minimal processing is done within the instrument software and/or maximum information is desired from as few injections as possible). As such, this App will be among the most complicated and is designed to be able to incorporate exported data from practically any setup with the end-result of compound-specific dD measurements.

A fair question might be: why? A common theme, at least in my experience, is that different labs do post-processing differently. This is perhaps fine, especially given the pecularities of each instrument and the specific goals of each lab. However, *how* we do post-processing can have a large impact on the final, reported value. The ideal to strive for is complete transparency in what, exactly, is done by each lab, even if those things are different. In addition, proper error reporting that incorporates both accuracy and precision are desirable. The flexibility, portability, and transparency of Shiny all make for an excellent vehicle to this ideal.
